# CharacterSubtraction
Subtraction of numbered characters in Cstring

This is a recent project that I did that subtracted numbers in an array.
The only difference is that these numbers were actually character instances and the subtraction had to be between two different Cstrings

A good understanding of the the ASCII encoding was key

Hope to add more intricate projects in the future!!!
